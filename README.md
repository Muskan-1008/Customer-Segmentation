Customer Segmentation

Overview:

This repository focuses on understanding customer behavior within a mall using clustering techniques. The project underwent exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and feature selection to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.

Models Applied:

K-means Clustering Algorithm:
Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.
Agglomerative Clustering
DBSCAN Clustering

Results:

Among the clustering algorithms tested, Hierarchical Clustering showed the most promising performance. It achieved a high Silhouette Score, indicating its effectiveness in segmenting customers based on their behavior within the mall.
