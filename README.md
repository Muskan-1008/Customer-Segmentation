# Customer-Segmentation

Here I performed model to understand the Customer behaviour of a mall

At First I performed Exploratory Data Analysis,Feature Engineering,Feature Selection on dataset to get useful insights.

I applied following models:

1)K-means Clustering Algorithm and find out number of clusters using Elbow Method and Silhouette Score

2) Agglomerative Clustering

3) DBSCAN Clustering


I found out that out of all above K-means have high Silhouette Score and hence the best model for this problem
